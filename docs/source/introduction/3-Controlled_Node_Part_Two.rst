Player Controlled Node Part Two
===============================

In this installment, weâ€™ll learn how to use player input to move a sprite around the screen.

The idea is simple:

* Each of the arrow keys moves the node in that direction
* Pushing a combination of up/down with left/right moves the node diagonally
* The player collects gems which increase the players.
* gems spawn randomly and when the last gem is collected more gems spawn.
