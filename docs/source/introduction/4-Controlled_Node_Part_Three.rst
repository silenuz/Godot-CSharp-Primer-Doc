Player Controlled Node Part Three
=================================

In this installment, weâ€™ll learn how to use player input to move a sprite around the screen.

The idea is simple:

* Asteroids style movement where left and right arrows rotate the ship
* Up and down arrow keys move the player forward and back
* Leaving one edge of the screen has you appear on the opposite side
* UFOs spawn randomly and have a stable trajectory and speed
* Random meteors that break int smaller rocks when shot
